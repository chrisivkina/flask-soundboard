# Flask Soundboard
An HTML / Python Flask sound effect player

## Description
This is a simple soundboard application built using Flask and HTML. 
It allows users to play sound effects by clicking on buttons. The intended
use is to have a separate device (like a phone or tablet) to play sound effects on,
but it can also be used on the same device as the server. The soundboard UI is hosted
on a web server, which can be accessed from any device on the same network.

## Features
- Play sound effects by clicking buttons
- Supports multiple types of sound files (WAV, MP3, OGG)
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop devices
- Customizable UI, allowing users to:
  - Sort and organize sound effects by categories;
  - Customize category container order and width;
- 

## Planned Features
- Installation guide
- Use Flask-SocketIO instead of HTTP requests
- Add settings menu (for changing sound device and more)

(And much more!)
